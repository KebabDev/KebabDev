# Hi, I'm Kebab (aka KebabDev or TastyKebab) 👋

## About Me

I'm an 18-year-old developer from Croatia with a passion for coding across a variety of platforms and languages.  
Currently, I’m focused on **Roblox game development**, but my experience spans a wide range of projects.

I've worked in **Python** for software development, **Java** in Minecraft modding, **web development** with **Flask**, and of course, **Lua** for scripting in Roblox.

## 🚀 Current Project
